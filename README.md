# The Thing
 Unity based 2D Platformer game
 
 The name comes from one my favorite movies The thing(1982) as in the beginning I wanted to make it themed like the movie but I couldn't find a package for that and I am not that good at photoshop so it would have taken to much time for only 1 person.
 The game has 10 levels(level 2-10 are just copies of each other) and there is a finish flag at the start of level 1 to enter level 2 in case you cannot finish the level(friends played it a bit and they got killed a lot in level 1)
